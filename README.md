# Forest_Type_Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts forest cover types using cartographic and ecological features such as elevation, slope, soil type, and more. Various models like decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression are used to classify forest regions accurately.





Forest Type Prediction Using Machine Learning
________________________________________
üìù Project Description





This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the forest cover type of a given region based on various geographic and cartographic features such as elevation, slope, soil type, hillshade, and more. The goal is to classify land areas into one of several forest cover types, making it a multi-class classification problem.
This project is valuable for ecological management, environmental planning, and resource monitoring, and demonstrates how ML models can be applied to real-world geospatial datasets.
